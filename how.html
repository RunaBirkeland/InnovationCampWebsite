            <p>We believe that the features offered by <em>Attender</em> will
            battle loneliness among students, aid teachers in providing better 
            guidance to their students and allow students to easily get in 
            touch with with a nurse or councellor when they need help. 
            Thus decreasing the number of students who choose to drop out 
            of high-school.</p>
