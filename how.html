            <p>We believe that the features offered by <em>Attender</em> will
            battle loneliness among students, aid teachers in providing better 
            guidance to their students and allow students to easily get in 
            touch with with a nurse or councellor when they need help. 
            Thus decreasing the number of students who choose to drop out 
            of high-school.</p>
            <p>The mentor program will facilitate a social network for new 
            students and give students who doesn't have a lot of friends or 
            has a hard time at home a place to go on occasional week nights. 
            It will also create a platform where older students can keep an 
            eye on younger students and allert the school if they notice 
            something is wrong. It will also give students an older student 
            to turn to when they don't want to go to a teacher or another adult, 
            creating several paths for getting help.
            </p>
            <p>The attendance data will allow students an overview of what they 
            missed if they failed to show up to class and give them a chance to 
            catch up on their own. This data will also help teachers to reach 
            out to student and help them through subjects where they struggle 
            or have fallen far behind.
            </p>
            <p>The reward system will make it more compelling to go to school, 
            and even more compelling to get back after a period of low attendance. 
            Motivating students to come to school, even when it's not so tempting.
            </p>
            <p>The chat-room where students can get in touch with either the 
            nurse or the guidance councellor will make it easier for students 
            to reach out when they need help. Instead of having to book an 
            appointment and physically going to the nurse, possibly drawing 
            attention to themselves doing so.
