    <section>
        <div>
            <p class="subtitle"><em>Attender</em> is an app containing several functions related to
            attendance tracking, social events and guidance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="purpleTextbox">
            <h2>Checking attendance</h2>
            <p class="lightText">Attender will be used by teachers and students to track
                attendance and check in to class. The app will, if allowed, use the smartphone's
                location to assertain the students whereabouts. If the student is not located
                near the class room, the student will get a notification asking them to check in. 
                The teacker will also be notified. In the event that the student is present, but the 
                app has failed to register, the teacher will be able to override the app. If a 
                student fails to attend they will get a notofication in the app and be asked if 
                they would like to talk to someone, a point we'll talk more about later.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="purpleTextbox">
            <h2>Usage of the data</h2>
            <p class="lightText">The data collected by the app will be used to track student's 
                attendance so the teachers can see which subjects they are missing and if 
                there is a pattern to their absence. Based on this data the school can help the 
                student before it's too late. This data may also give insight into the cause 
                of the absence, whether it's social or curricular. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="purpleTextbox">
            <h2>Adaptive teaching</h2>
            <p class="lightText">When a student is absent from a class the class will show
                up red in their schedule in the app and it will also say what chapters and 
                themes were reviewed during that class. If the student misses several classes 
                and the teacher notices that the pattern is that the student avoids classes 
                that are heavily theoretical they will be able to create an alternative 
                teaching method for this student. If it's just a one-time thing, the student 
                themselves will have access to what was done in class so they can easily catch up.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="purpleTextbox">
            <h2>Reward system</h2>
            <p class="lightText">In order to make it even more tempting to get back to school <em>Attender</em>
            contains a reward system. When a student shows up consistently they build up a 
            so called "streak", the longer they keep it going the more a "progress bar" increases 
            once the progress bar is full the student unlocks a reward like a ticket to the 
            movies or a free drink from the canteen. The prizes should not be too grand 
            to avoid there being too much focus on it and to decrease the "gamification".
            If a student has been dropping out of classes and stopped showing up to school 
            but then manages to get back they receive a "comeback bonus" rewarding them for 
            getting back to school.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="purpleTextbox">
            <h2>Mentor program</h2>
            <p class="lightText">In order to battle the issue of social isolation and 
            improve a students chances of finding new friends <em>Attender</em> will 
            require the schools using the app to put into action a mentor program. 
            second year and third year high schoolers will act as mentors or the Norwegian 
            version: "faddere" on a voluntary basis or as an extra curicular activity. 
            All first year students will be assigned to a mentor group. The mentors leading 
            the groups will be responsible for planning and executing social events like 
            afternoon boardgame sessions, football matches or movie nights. The school 
            will supply the mentor groups with places to host these events. The mentors 
            can collaborate when arranging the events and host mixers where the different 
            groups can meet, when their not hosting events that are exclusive for their 
            particular group. If a student starts missing classes their mentor will be 
            allerted, so they too can reach out to the student and try to help. A mentor 
            will also have the option to report a student to the school nurse or guidance 
            councellor if they feel that the student needs professional help. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="purpleTextbox">
            <h2>Counceling</h2>
            <p class="lightText">Through the app a student will be able to talk to the 
            school nurse and guidance councellor via a chat-room. We believe that this 
            will lower the threshold for getting help when needed. Mentors will also 
            have shortcut to alert the school nurse about students that might need help.
            This will allow the school nurse to get in touch with students before it's 
            too late thanks to them having eyes and ears on the floor through the mentors. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="purpleTextbox">
            <h2>Security and financing</h2>
            <p class="lightText"><em>Attender</em> will be developed with the students 
            security in mind with a major focus on the rules of GDPR. The app is built 
            on an already existing system that is in use in several high schools 
            called <em>NOA</em>.</p>
            <p class="lightText">The app should be tested in a few schools to assertain 
            if it works. If after this period of testing the app is proven to work the 
            individual county municipalities will be responsible for financing the app. 
            Because the reduction in drop-outs will significantly lower costs related 
            to social care, we believe that the app will be a sound investment.
