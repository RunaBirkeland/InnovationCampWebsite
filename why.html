            <p><em>You're in your second year of high school in math class.
                You're sitting next to one of your classmates, Dan. Dan is a quiet guy,
                but he always lends you a pencil when you've forgotten your own.
                During the second semester, however, you notice that Dan stops
                showing up to math class. You ask around and it turns out Dan has stopped
                showing up to school all together. Dan has dropped out.</em></p>

            Around 30% of students in Norway drop out of high school.</a>

            Utdanningsforbundet states that people who have failed to complete high school
            generally have a lower income and are more likely to claim social benefits
            than people who complete high school. The reason for these drop-outs
            are hard to pin down, but NIFU has found that it could be

            connected to the requirements seeming unattainable to students with a lower grade 
            from secondary school, lack of motivation and a difficult life outside 
            of school.</a> <em>Attender</em> aims to solve these issues.</p>
